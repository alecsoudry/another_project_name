This project looks at a dataset of ebay auction data. Training and validation models have been created to determine the competitiveness of all items listed for auction. A backward elimination and stepwise regression are done to preliminarily determine are correlation, followed by a logistic regression to get the std. error and z-value for each variable. Finally a confusion matrix was produced to gather more in-depth statistical information, along with a lift and decline lift chart to provide a visual component.
